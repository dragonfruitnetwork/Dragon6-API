## Contributing Guide

If you have found a problem or have an idea that could be of great benefit to the project, feel free to create an issue or even fork the repo and impliment it yourself. We welcome contributions but please note the following:

When reporting/commenting an issue:
- Search beforehand
- Check the Wiki and Getting Started Guide to see if your question was answered
- If you have created an issue and haven't responded, we will close the issue. Please don't create lots of issues because you were too lazy to respond. We'll keep issues open for 7-10 days before closing them if we don't get the info required
- Fill out the template if one was provided
- Please don't inflate the comments by posting +1 comments
- Stay on-topic (if we can't we can move the discussion to discord)
- Don't keep asking if something has been added or resolved. Only do this if it is breaking you app with lots of users and need a fast turnaround.

When opening a pull request:
- Finish the PR before submitting it (unless there is a need for discussion)
- Don't use the GitHub web interface if you can avoid it (it shows the tests haven't been run and can mess up the line spacings)
- Don't force push unless absolutely necessary
- You will need to have some knowledge of C# and Newtonsoft.Json project. We will give some guidance but you really need to know the basics to make this productive
- If you want to work on the networking and data collection side of things, check out [DragonFruit.Common](https://github.com/dragonfruitnetwork/DragonFruit.Common/wiki/Getting-Started:-Requests), the custom-built web framework we use.
